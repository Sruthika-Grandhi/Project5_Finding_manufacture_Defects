## Overview

This project focuses on detecting manufacturing defects using a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN).

In manufacturing industries, detecting defects such as cracks, scratches, dents, and surface abnormalities is essential for maintaining product quality. Manual inspection methods are slow, costly, and prone to human error. This project solves that problem by learning the distribution of normal (defect-free) manufacturing images and generating condition-specific normal images.

The generated images are compared with real inspection images to identify deviations, which indicate potential defects. This helps automate quality inspection and improve reliability.

## Project Objectives

- Learn the distribution of normal manufacturing images
- Generate realistic condition-based manufacturing images
- Detect defects using CGAN
- Reduce manual inspection effort
- Improve quality control accuracy
- Provide reusable CGAN defect detection framework

---

## Training Workflow

1. Load manufacturing dataset
2. Preprocess images (resize , normalize)
3. Initialize Conditional Generator and Discriminator
4. Train CGAN using adversarial learning
5. Generate normal images
6. Save trained Generator model
7. Use model for defect detection
